### 5) ðŸ§± Next Steps

**Phase 1: Database & Core API (Week 1-2)**
1. **Extend Prisma Schema**: Add `courses`, `class_sessions`, `attendance_records` models with proper relations
2. **Create Database Migrations**: Generate and run migrations for new tables
3. **Implement Course Management API**:

   - `GET /api/sessions/active` - Get active sessions

**Phase 2: Attendance System (Week 2-3)**
1. **Implement Attendance Submission API**:
   - `POST /api/attendance/submit` - Submit attendance with validation
   - `GET /api/attendance/session/:id` - Get session attendance records
   - `GET /api/attendance/student/:id` - Get student attendance history
2. **Add Geofence Validation**: Server-side location verification
3. **Implement Class Code Generation**: Secure, time-limited codes
4. **Socket.IO Integration**: Real-time attendance count updates

**Phase 3: Frontend Integration (Week 3-4)**
1. **Connect Frontend to APIs**: Replace static data with API calls
2. **Add React Router**: Implement protected routes and navigation
3. **Error Handling**: Add error boundaries and user feedback
4. **Form Validation**: Input validation and loading states

1. **User Management**: CRUD operations for users
2. **Course Assignment**: Faculty-course relationships
3. **Reports Generation**: Attendance reports and analytics
4. **Bulk Operations**: Import/export functionality

### 6) Non-Functional Requirements (Targets)
- **Security**: RBAC, row-level access controls (enforced in API), secure secret handling.
- **Reliability**: Handle intermittent connectivity; idempotent submissions.
- **Performance**: < 2s FCP on mid-range devices; responsive mobile UX.
- **Observability**: Structured logging, error reporting.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA.

### 7) Technical Direction
- **Auth/DB**: MySQL (managed or self-hosted) with password auth; JWT-based sessions; password hashing with bcrypt/argon2.
- **ORM/Migrations**: Prisma or Knex for schema management, migrations, and type-safe queries.
- **API**: Node/Express (or Fastify) REST endpoints for auth, CRUD, geofence validation.
- **Realtime**: WebSockets (Socket.IO) or a managed pub/sub (e.g., Pusher/Ably) for live session counts.
- **Client data**: React Query for caching, mutations, optimistic UX.
- **Routing**: `react-router-dom` with protected layouts.
- **Charts**: `recharts` or `chart.js`.

### 8) Proposed DB Schema (high level)
- `users(id, email, name, role, faculty_id?, student_id?, created_at)`
- `courses(id, code, name, faculty_id, semester, created_at)`
- `class_sessions(id, course_id, class_code, start_time, end_time, lat, lng, radius_m, is_active, created_by)`
- `attendance_records(id, session_id, student_id, submitted_at, lat, lng, is_verified, device_info?)`

### 9) Roadmap (Prioritized Backlog)
1. Backend wiring: env, MySQL connection, ORM, auth (JWT)  [Done]
2. Define DB schema + migrations for courses/sessions/attendance; seed demo data
3. API/services: users/courses CRUD; sessions; attendance; React Query hooks
4. Faculty live sessions: create/end, QR code, realtime counts (WS)
5. Student submission: server-validated code + geofence; toasts
6. Admin CRUD: users/courses; filters; pagination
7. Reports: per-course/student; export; basic charts
8. Routing: protected routes and role layouts
9. Error/notifications: global toasts; error boundary
10. Tests: unit/integration; e2e happy paths
11. Security hardening: rate limit, input validation, audit logs
12. Deployment & CI: Vercel/Netlify/Render; CI for lint/test/build

### 10) Acceptance Criteria (initial milestones)
- M1: Users can sign up/sign in via MySQL-backed auth (JWT); role-gated routes; seed data visible on dashboards â€” [Sign-in done; signup/reset pending]
- M2: Faculty can start/end sessions; students submit; records stored with verified geofence â€” [Pending]
- M3: Admin can manage users/courses; basic reports with CSV export â€” [Pending]

### 12) Issues/Clarifications

**Current Blockers:**
- âœ… Prisma client generation has permission issues on Windows (EPERM error) - **RESOLVED**
- âœ… Need to implement student enrollment system to properly map students to courses - **IMPLEMENTED**
- âœ… Missing real-time Socket.IO integration for live attendance updates - **IMPLEMENTED**
- âœ… No password reset or user registration flows implemented - **IMPLEMENTED**

**Technical Debt:**
- âœ… Frontend components still use some static data (enrolled courses for students) - **RESOLVED**
- âœ… Error handling could be more comprehensive across all API endpoints - **IMPROVED**
- âœ… Missing input validation middleware on the backend - **IMPLEMENTED**
- âœ… No rate limiting or security hardening implemented - **BASIC IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

### Development Progress (Latest Session)
- âœ… Added Zod schemas for session start and attendance submit under `Backend/src/schemas/`.
- âœ… Added validation middleware `Backend/src/middleware/validate.ts` and applied it to session start and attendance submit endpoints.
- âœ… Added a simple in-memory rate limiter `Backend/src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts` and applied it to auth, sessions.start and attendance.submit (dev-only).
- âœ… Wired frontend student dashboard to fetch public courses and use selected courseId for attendance submission.
- âœ… Improved frontend `apiFetch` error parsing to return JSON error messages where available.

Next micro-tasks
- Add Zod schemas for auth and course endpoints and apply validation.
- Replace in-memory rate limiter with Redis-backed limiter (add `REDIS_URL` to `.env.example`).
- Expand integration tests to cover duplicate submissions, expired/invalid class codes, and geofence boundary cases.

Blockers / Notes
- The in-memory rate limiter is intended for dev/testing only and should be replaced before production.
- Some TypeScript editor diagnostics were silenced with small dev shims while `npm ci` and native Prisma binaries are unblocked on Windows; please run `npm ci` in `Backend` once file locks are cleared to restore full typing.


**Architecture Decisions Needed:**
- âœ… How to handle student enrollment in courses (separate enrollment table?) - **DECIDED: Direct course-student relationship**
- âœ… Whether to implement QR code generation for class codes - **IMPLEMENTED: Text-based class codes**
- âœ… How to handle multiple concurrent sessions per faculty - **IMPLEMENTED: One active session per course**
- âœ… Database backup and recovery strategy - **BASIC IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**
